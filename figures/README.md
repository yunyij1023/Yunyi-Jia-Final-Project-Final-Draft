This is the figures directory which contains four figures of the study. Figure1 is the histogram of BMI of bariatric surgery patients. Figure1 shows the distribution of BMI is unimodal and slightly right skewed. Figure2 is the histogram of Obesity Duration of bariatric surgery patients. Figure2 shows the distribution of Obesity Duration is multimodal and more right skewed. Figure3 is the box plot and strip plot of BMI for biopsy results of liver steatosis. Figure3 shows the median BMI are close between liver steatosis patients and non-liver steatosis patients. The distribution of the data is more even in non-liver steatosis patients. Figure 4 is the box plot and strip plot of Obesity Duration for biopsy results of liver steatosis. Figure4 shows that the median obesity duration is slightly higher in liver steatosis patients. The distribution of data is more even in non-liver steatosis patients.
